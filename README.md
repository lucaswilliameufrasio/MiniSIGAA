# MiniSIGAA

This project was built for Architecture and Database Performance class at University. It has the purpose to show the transactions, queries, triggers, functions, so on and so forth. As you can see, this is no completly functional and do not have all features implemented, the reason for that is because i had another classes and other projects to build.

Disclaimer: The performance field, query optimization, was exercised through hand written homework.
